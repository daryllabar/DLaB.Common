# DLaB.Common [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/kw499ku7nn7ly5si/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/daryllabar/dlab.common)

Set of helper files for accessing Config, working with TFS, some common exceptions, and a Type Safe Enum Base

## How Can I Use It?

There are two methods for utilizing the code base, depending on how you'd like to consume the code base.  

1.  **Use NuGet** - This is by far the quickest and easiet method.  Search for and add the NuGet Package "DLaB.Common" to your .Net Project.  
2.  **Use NuGet Source Only Packages** - This is provided as a workaround for situations that don't allow references, like in a Sandbox on a platform.  Search for and add the NuGet Package "DLaB.Common.Source" to your .Net Project.  


## How Can I Help?

DLaB.Common is designed to be a community focused, open sourced project.  There are two main ways to help:
Please submit an issue for bugs/feature requests.  If you'd like to contribute:

1.  **Create an issue for a bug/feature request.** - If you find a bug or have an idea for a new feature or just need something that is missing, [please create an issue](https://github.com/daryllabar/DLaB.Common/issues/new)!  There is no better way to make things better than to share.
2.  **Submit a Pull Request.** - I would highly recommend using the [XrmUnitTest Gitter Room](https://gitter.im/daryllabar/XrmUnitTest), before doing any major coding.  It's a great place to discuss what you'd like to do and get an offical blessing before starting any work!
